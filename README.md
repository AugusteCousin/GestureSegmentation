# GestureSegmentation
Machine learning model for gesture segmentation

Project for an internship at NUILab, Colorado State University in spring 2020.

Building a model to segment gestures in complexe videos.

Dataset used is the EGGNOG dataset of gestures.

The technology used is Reccurent neural networks.

"
My objective during this internship was to segment gestures in Kinect videos using machine learning. I used a recent dataset from the university containing RGB and skeleton videos.
I used TensorFlow and Scikitlearn and implemented recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU). I evaluated my results against a non-machine learning implementation that was using Dynamic Time Warping and computed curvatures to segment the gestures.
I experienced working in a research laboratory and developed a full project from data preparations to verification of the results."
